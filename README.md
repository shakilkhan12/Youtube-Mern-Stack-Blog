<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't
find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to
create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need --
I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that
  solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README
  from scratch
- You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be
different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest
changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the
acknowledgements.
